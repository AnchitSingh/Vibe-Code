// Welcome to the vibe-system - The dead-simple way to run stuff in parallel.
// No complex setup, no manual thread management. Just vibe and code.
//
// This file shows you how it works with a few examples.
// To run this, just use: `cargo run --release`
// (Use --release for a real performance feel!)
